How to take a note in these ai days? **SPEED** 
- Introducing a tool: Picture(concept) -> input(example) -> output.
- Only write down **short questions**
- Using excalidraw to connect **concept** **usage**(code, examplem, IO)
- Only write keywords

Review:
1. Try your best to describe them using your own language
2. Asking AI which part you're not familiar with(keywords questions concepts).
3. Capture the main frame and important content to excalidraw
	- If just some superficial issus -> Don't record
	- Deep and all round & Using frequently -> record(**new node**)
		- If the problem like a big class -> using excalidraw
		- Some core problem -> markdown
