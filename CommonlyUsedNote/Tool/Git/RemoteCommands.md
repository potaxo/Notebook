You’re trying to push to GitHub using HTTPS with a username and password, but GitHub **no longer allows password authentication for Git operations**. They only support either:

1. **SSH keys**
2. **HTTPS with a Personal Access Token (PAT)**

Let’s decode your situation:

* Your error says:

  ```
  remote: Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported for Git operations.
  ```

  That means Git interpreted your password entry as a regular password, not as a token.

---

### How to fix it

#### Option 1: Use SSH (recommended)

1. Generate an SSH key if you don’t have one:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   (press enter to accept defaults)

2. Start the ssh-agent and add the key:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

3. Copy the public key:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

   Add it to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → "New SSH key".

4. Change your repo remote to SSH:

   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:potaxo/dotfiles.git
   ```

5. Now try:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

#### Option 2: Use HTTPS with Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic).
2. Generate a new token with `repo` permission.
3. When you push, use:

   * Username: your GitHub username (`potaxo`)
   * Password: your token (paste it instead of your real password)

If you don’t want to re-enter it every time:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

⚡ Forward-thinking tip: SSH is more convenient long-term since it avoids typing tokens, and you can even use passphrases with ssh-agent for security. If you’re managing multiple machines (like WSL2 + Windows), syncing your SSH setup will save you lots of hassle.

Do you want me to walk you through **switching your current repo to SSH** (probably the cleanest fix for your case)?

You’re asking what these two commands do:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Let’s unpack them carefully.

---

### 1. `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`

* `ssh-agent` is a background program that holds your **private SSH keys** in memory.
  This way, you don’t have to type your passphrase every single time you use the key.
* `-s` tells it to output shell commands that set up environment variables (like `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and `SSH_AGENT_PID`) so your current shell knows how to talk to the agent.
* `eval` executes those shell commands in your current session.

So, this line **starts an ssh-agent process and connects your shell to it.**

---

### 2. `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

* `ssh-add` is used to add a private key to the running `ssh-agent`.
* `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` is the default private key file you generated with `ssh-keygen`.

When you run this:

* If your private key has a passphrase, it will ask you for it once.
* After that, the agent keeps the decrypted key in memory, and you don’t have to retype the passphrase every time you push/pull to GitHub.

---

### Analogy

Think of `ssh-agent` as a **keychain manager**:

* `ssh-agent` = the keychain.
* `ssh-add` = putting your house key into the keychain.
* Once added, every program (like `git`) can ask the keychain for the key, instead of you fishing it out and typing the password again.

---

⚡ Forward-thinking tip: In WSL2, it’s often useful to set up your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` so it auto-starts `ssh-agent` and adds your key when you open a shell. That way, you never forget to do it and your git workflow stays smooth.

Do you want me to show you how to automate this so you don’t have to run those two commands manually every time?

You’re asking what **ed25519** means in `id_ed25519`, and whether you can change it.

---

### What is **ed25519**?

* **ed25519** is the name of a modern cryptographic algorithm used for generating SSH keys.
* It’s based on **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**, specifically the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm over Curve25519.
* Compared to older RSA keys, **ed25519 keys are:**

  * Much **smaller** (shorter files and faster to compute).
  * Just as **secure** (an ed25519 key with 256 bits is roughly comparable in strength to a 3072-bit RSA key).
  * **Preferred** by GitHub and most modern systems as the default key type.

So when you do:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

you’re telling `ssh-keygen` to generate a keypair using this algorithm. The private key goes in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, and the public key in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.

---

### Can you change it?

Yes, you have options:

* **RSA (older, still supported):**

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```

  Generates `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
  RSA is still fine, but larger and slower.

* **ECDSA or Ed448 (other elliptic curves):**

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t ed448 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```

  These exist but aren’t as widely recommended as ed25519.

* **Custom filename:**
  You can also change the name of the key file:

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/my_custom_key -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```

  That would give you `my_custom_key` and `my_custom_key.pub`.
  Just remember: if you rename it, you must tell `ssh-add` and your SSH config which file to use.

---

### In short

* **ed25519** is a modern, secure default — best choice for GitHub today.
* You *can* use RSA or another type, but unless you need compatibility with some ancient system, stick with ed25519.
* You *can* rename the file, but then you must explicitly manage it.

---

⚡ Forward-thinking tip: If you plan to use multiple SSH keys (e.g., one for GitHub, one for your university’s servers), it’s best to name them differently (`id_ed25519_github`, `id_ed25519_uni`) and configure them in `~/.ssh/config`. That keeps your digital keyring neat and avoids conflicts.

Do you want me to show you how to set up an `~/.ssh/config` so you can handle multiple keys easily?

You’re asking: if you have many SSH key pairs, how do you tell them apart and manage them. That’s a very practical question — because once you start using GitHub, GitLab, university servers, personal VPS, and cloud services, you end up with a pocketful of digital keys jangling around.

---

### Ways to identify your SSH keys

1. **By filename**

   * When generating keys, you can give them descriptive names:

     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github -C "your_github_email@example.com"
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_uni -C "student@university.edu"
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_server -C "server login"
     ```
   * This gives you separate files like:

     * `id_ed25519_github` / `id_ed25519_github.pub`
     * `id_ed25519_uni` / `id_ed25519_uni.pub`
     * `id_ed25519_server` / `id_ed25519_server.pub`

2. **By public key comment**

   * The `-C "comment"` you add during `ssh-keygen` is stored at the end of the `.pub` file. Example:

     ```
     ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nz...longkey... your_github_email@example.com
     ```
   * You can open `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github.pub` and instantly see which key belongs to which service.

3. **Using `ssh-add -l`**

   * If you’ve added keys to the agent:

     ```bash
     ssh-add -l
     ```

     Output shows fingerprints and filenames:

     ```
     256 SHA256:abc123... /home/potaxo/.ssh/id_ed25519_github (ED25519)
     256 SHA256:def456... /home/potaxo/.ssh/id_ed25519_uni (ED25519)
     ```

4. **Using `~/.ssh/config`**
   This file lets you map a key to a specific host. Example:

   ```ssh
   Host github.com
       User git
       HostName github.com
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github

   Host uni-server
       User student
       HostName ssh.university.edu
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_uni

   Host my-vps
       User root
       HostName 203.0.113.42
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_server
   ```

   Now you don’t need to remember which key goes where — SSH handles it for you.
   Running `ssh github.com` will automatically use the GitHub key.

---

### In short

* **Filename convention** = most straightforward way to distinguish.
* **Comments** inside `.pub` files = quick human-readable ID.
* **ssh-agent listing** = shows loaded keys.
* **ssh config** = the ultimate way to automate which key is used for which service.

---

⚡ Forward-thinking tip: Treat your SSH keys like a real-world keyring. Label them clearly, don’t reuse the same one everywhere, and back them up securely. If one gets compromised, you only need to replace that single key instead of your entire digital identity.

Do you want me to show you how to make a clean `~/.ssh/config` template you can expand as you add more keys?
