✅ Great debugging question — you’re clearly thinking like a software engineer. Let’s go through this carefully and solve it 100%.

---

## 🔍 Restating your question

You ran this in your terminal:

```bash
conda list | grep pandas
```

It shows:

```bash
pandas 2.3.1 pypi_0 pypi
```

But when you run your Python script from **VS Code**, you get:

```text
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'
```

So the script cannot find the `pandas` module — **even though you installed it**.

---

## 🎯 Root Cause: **VS Code is not using the same Python as your terminal**

Let’s break it down:

| In Terminal                            | In VS Code                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You’re using `conda activate d2l-rocm` | VS Code is using its own default interpreter (`/bin/python3`) |
| pandas is installed in `d2l-rocm`      | VS Code runs system Python, where pandas is not installed     |

---

## ✅ How to fix it: **Set the correct Python interpreter in VS Code**

### 🔧 Steps:

1. Open your project in VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `F1`) to open the Command Palette.
3. Type:

   ```
   Python: Select Interpreter
   ```
4. Choose the one that matches your `d2l-rocm` environment — it will look like:

   ```
   ~/miniconda3/envs/d2l-rocm/bin/python
   ```

   (Or something similar depending on your system.)

✅ Now, VS Code will use the Python environment that already has `pandas`.

---

## 🔍 How to confirm it’s fixed

In VS Code's terminal or output, run:

```bash
which python
```

It should now point to:

```bash
/home/potaxo/miniconda3/envs/d2l-rocm/bin/python
```

Also try this in your script:

```python
import sys
print(sys.executable)
```

That’ll show you **exactly which Python** the script is using.

---

## 🔁 Alternative Fix (not recommended long-term)

If you don’t want to change the VS Code interpreter, you can force your script to use Conda from the terminal like this:

```bash
conda activate d2l-rocm
python testcode.py
```

But this bypasses VS Code’s internal execution and **you lose IntelliSense and environment awareness**.

---

## 🔭 Forward-thinking tip

👉 **VS Code supports automatic environment detection**, but sometimes fails with WSL or multiple Conda setups.

To make it easier in the future:

* Use `.vscode/settings.json` in your project to **lock in the right interpreter**:

```json
{
  "python.pythonPath": "/home/potaxo/miniconda3/envs/d2l-rocm/bin/python"
}
```

Then you’ll never have to worry about mismatched environments again. Want me to generate that file for you? 🎯
