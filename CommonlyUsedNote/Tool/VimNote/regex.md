That's a fantastic and very logical question! It cuts right to one of the most common points of confusion when learning regular expressions. The simple answer is that the square brackets `[]` have their own special syntax where listing characters together automatically means "OR".

Inside a character class `[]`, the pipe `|` is not a special "OR" operator; it's treated as a literal character you want to match.

Let's break down the two different ways regex says "OR".

***

### 1. The Character Class `[]`: An "OR" for Single Characters

Think of a character class `[]` as a **"bag of allowed characters"**. You're telling the regex engine: "You are allowed to match **any single character** that I've put inside this bag."

* **`[0-9.]`**: This creates a bag containing the digits `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9` and the literal dot character `.`. The regex will successfully match any *one* of those characters. The "OR" is implied by the nature of the bag.

* **`[0-9|.]`**: This is where the confusion arises. Because you're inside the `[]` "bag", the pipe symbol `|` loses its special power. It's no longer an operator; it's just another character thrown into the bag. This expression means: "Match a single character that is a digit from `0-9`, OR a literal pipe `|`, OR a literal dot `.`". This is not the intended logic for matching an IP address, as IP addresses don't contain pipe symbols.

### 2. The Alternation Pipe `|`: An "OR" for Expressions

The pipe symbol `|` is used for **alternation** between entire expressions, patterns, or groups. Think of it as a **"fork in the road"** for the regex engine. It tells the engine: "Try to match the entire expression on the left. If you can't, then try to match the entire expression on the right."

* **`cat|dog`**: This means "Match the exact sequence of characters `c-a-t` **OR** match the exact sequence of characters `d-o-g`". It doesn't mean "match a `c` or `a` or `t` or `d`...".

* **`(invalid )?user`**: In our original example, `Disconnected from (invalid )?user`, the `?` applies to the group `(invalid )`. This means the group is optional. An equivalent way to write this with a pipe might be `(invalid user|user)`, which means "match `invalid user` OR match `user`". This shows how `|` works on whole chunks of text.

### Summary Table

Here's a table to make the distinction crystal clear:

| Syntax | Type | Meaning | Example Match |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`[abc]`** | Character Class | Match a single character: 'a' **or** 'b' **or** 'c'. | `a` |
| **`a\|b\|c`** | Alternation | Match a single character: 'a' **or** 'b' **or** 'c'. | `a` |
| **`[cat]`** | Character Class | Match a single character: 'c' **or** 'a' **or** 't'. | `t` |
| **`cat\|dog`** | Alternation | Match the whole word 'cat' **or** the whole word 'dog'. | `dog` |

The key takeaway is:
* Inside `[]`, everything is a literal character and the "OR" is implied for all of them.
* Outside `[]`, the `|` is a powerful "OR" operator that chooses between entire patterns.

Your intuition to use `|` for "OR" was spot on! You just discovered one of the special rules of regex syntax where the `[]` brackets create their own little world with a simpler set of rules. Keep asking these kinds of questionsâ€”it's the fastest way to master these concepts! ðŸ’¡
