You’re asking: how to actually **use `z`** (directory jumper) and **`fzf`** (fuzzy finder) after installing them in zsh. Let’s break it down in plain moves.

---

## 1. Using **z**

`z` is like a teleport spell for directories. Instead of typing a long `cd ~/projects/super/long/path`, you just use a remembered keyword.

* First, `z` learns your habits. As you `cd` around, it builds a database of paths.
* Then you can do things like:

```bash
z proj
```

→ jumps to the most used directory matching "proj".

```bash
z down
```

→ might take you to `~/Downloads` if you’ve been there often.

```bash
z -l keyword
```

→ lists all matches instead of jumping straight away.

```bash
z -c keyword
```

→ only matches subdirectories of the current directory.

It’s simple: the more you visit a place, the faster `z` will take you there.

## 2. Using **fzf**

`fzf` is a **fuzzy finder**—basically a search box in your terminal. You type part of what you’re looking for, and it interactively filters results.

### Common usages:

* **Search command history**:

```bash
Ctrl+R
```

(replaces default history search with an interactive fzf-powered one if properly integrated).

* **Search files in current directory**:

```bash
fzf
```

Type a few letters and it narrows down. Press **Enter** to output the selected file.

Example:

```bash
vim $(fzf)
```

→ opens the file you pick.

* **Search directories**:

```bash
cd $(find . -type d | fzf)
```

→ interactive `cd`.

* **Search processes**:

```bash
ps aux | fzf
```

→ fuzzy-pick a process, then act on it.

### Bonus tricks:

* `fzf --preview 'bat --style=numbers --color=always {}'`
  → lets you preview file contents (requires `bat` installed).

* Combine with git:

```bash
git checkout $(git branch | fzf)
```

→ pick a branch interactively.

### Forward-thinking tip

Both `z` and `fzf` are about **speeding up navigation**. They save keystrokes and mental load. Once you’re comfortable, you can even wire them together—for example, `cd $(z -l | fzf)` to pick a remembered directory interactively.

---

Do you want me to craft you a **ready-to-use `.zshrc` setup** where `z` and `fzf` are fully integrated with nice keybindings (like `Ctrl+T` for file search, `Ctrl+R` for history, `Alt+C` for directory jump)?
